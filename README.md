# GuessingGame
The goal of the game is for the player to guess a random number.
Computer generates a number between 0 and 100.
Then the player chooses difficulty level - - easy or hard. 
Easy level gives the player 10 attempts to guess the number.
Hard level gives the player 5 attempts to guess the number.
After each guess, the computer is giving a small hint of whether the guessed number is either too small or too large.

If the player guesses the number within their given attempts, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.
